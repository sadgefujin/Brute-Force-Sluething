Brute Force Sleuthing (Penetration Testing Project)
Project Description
This project involved conducting a Brute Force Attack as part of a penetration testing exercise on a vulnerable web application (A-Z Edu). The project utilized Burp Suite, specifically the Intruder module with the Sniper technique, to execute the attack using wordlists.

Key activities performed during this project included:

Identifying vulnerabilities in the target web application.

Monitoring the progress of the brute force attack.

Analyzing the results to assess the effectiveness of the attack.

Providing recommendations for improved security measures, such as stronger password policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Web Application Firewalls (WAF).

This project served to demonstrate practical skills in vulnerability assessment and web application penetration testing methodologies.
